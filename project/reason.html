  <div><h1>Why did I choose "tanketorsk"?</h1></div>

  <div>
    <p class = "starting">
    The direct reason is…well, I just googled “untranslatable Danish”, and chose “tanketorsk” from the list of words. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class = "topicS">
    <h3>Emmmm...Untranslatable?</h3>
  </div>

  <div class = "index">
    <p>
      I think the word "tanketorsk" is untranslatable, of course, because it 
      is difficult to find a direct translation in English. A closer word might
       be "mistake," but the word "mistake" places more emphasis on the consequences 
       of wrong action, while "tanketorsk" emphasizes that the action was unintentional 
       and did not necessarily result in any serious consequences (but may).
      <br><br>
      As a native Chinese speaker, I could not find the direct translation of "tanketorsk" in 
      Chinese either. Closer words such as "无心之过" mean a mistake made accidentally, 
      but also place more emphasis on the fact that the result is “wrong” or “bad”, rather than stupid or foolish.

    <h3>I'd like to mention, for fun: Freudian Slip</h3>
  </div>

  <div class = "index">
    <p>
        "Tanketorsk" also reminds me of another interesting phrase, 
        "Freudian slip", a phrase which, according to the dictionary, means 
        "an unintentional error regarded as revealing subconscious feelings". 
        In fact, "Freudian slip" describes a scenario that can be similar to 
        "tanketorsk", but originally as a psychological term (and now, of course, 
        as an everyday term), “Freudian slip” puts the emphasis on the subconsciousness, 
        and emphasizes that the wrong or foolish behavior due to the lack of focus is mainly an expression of your subconscious. 
        In addition, "Freudian slip" is usually used for language and less for behavior.

    <h3>Lifestyle? Culture? Maybe...hygge?</h3>
  </div>

  <div class = "index">
    <p>
        Unlike the word "hygge", "tanketorsk" is not directly related to the Danish lifestyle or culture. 
        However, upon deeper understanding of the word, it is self-deprecating and seems to have a sense of
         humor, which also succinctly expresses a spontaneous attitude towards life. There are inevitably 
         moments in our lives when we get carried away; we don't need to dwell too much on the silly things
          we do or the small mistakes we make, just laugh it off. <br>
          That's why I chose this word.
