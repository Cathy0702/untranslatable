    Are there moments in your life when you say something stupid or make some thoughtless move because you were distracted or you were not really thinking? 
    There can be many, many examples of this, such as accidentally turning in a CPSC assignment as a Danish assignment, 
    or confusing a friend's name in a conversation. If something similar has happened to you, then you have experienced a "Tanketorsk".

    <h3>So, what is "en tanketorsk", officially?</h3>

  <div class = "index">
    <p>
      In Den Danske Ordbog, the word “tanketorsk” is defined as “tåbelig udtalelse eller handling som skyldes manglende omtanke”, 
      which can be direct translated to “foolish statement or action due to a lack of consideration”. 
      There are also websites that define it as “a term to describe an inadvertent mistake or thoughtless action”. 
      <br><br>
      It is worth noting that these definitions usually emphasize key points like "statement", 
      "action", “foolish”, and "thoughtless" . That is, "en tanketorsk" 
      can include both foolish language or behavior that are unintended rather than intentional, 
      and mostly caused by a lack of attention or focus.
